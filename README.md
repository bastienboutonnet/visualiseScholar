# Visualise Scholar
This R package will basically provide a series of wrapping functions around Kierstead's R [scholar package](https://github.com/jkeirstead/scholar) to output ready made graphs with some styling options etc.

More to come soon.

## Todo:
- write first functions
- build up into an R package
